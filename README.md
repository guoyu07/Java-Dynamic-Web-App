# Java-Dynamic-Web-App
Servlets, JSP, HTML and Tomcat. A simple beginning to a web application. 

This is part of an application. There is a login screen which will allow authorized 
users to accesss. Behind the scenes a servlet takes care of this in conjunction with
a Filter. A hit counter will log the number of successful logins during the session. 
There is a button menu to select options from only one is implemented at the moment. 
You will get an HTTP error if you select the unimplemented options. When you select
schedule a JSP file will be launched and present an example schedule created by a 
scriplet. There is a logout screen and confirmation of logout.

The application uses Servlets, Filters, Annotations, JSP pages, HTML pages and a little CSS.
